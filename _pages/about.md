**<font size=6> About Me </font>**

**Experience:** I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Trento (UNITN). I was a Postdoc at UNITN from 2020-2022 under the supervision of Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/). I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 from the Cognitive Science Department at Xiamen University under the supervision of Prof. [Shaozi Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CT8_b_QAAAAJ&hl=en). I was also a joint Ph.D. student in 2017-2019 at University of Technology Sydney under the co-supervision of Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab.cecs.anu.edu.au/). I received the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2015 from China University Of Petroleum, Qingdao, China. I received the B.S. degree from the Information Engineering Department, from East China University of Technology in 2012.

**Research Interests:** I commit to designing robust and scalable visual recognition systems for real-world applications. To achieve this goal, I mainly focus on the areas of data augmentation, unsupervised/semi- supervised learning, domain generalization, domain adaptation and novel class discovery, and investigate their advantages in visual tasks, such as object retrieval, image classification, semantic segmentation, etc.

<span style="color:orangered"> **Join Us:** Our group ([MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/)
 led by Prof. Nicu Sebe) is looking for highly-motivated Postdoc/Ph.D. students; we also welcome visiting students. Drop me an email if you are interested.</span>
