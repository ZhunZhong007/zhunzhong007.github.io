**<font size=6> About Me </font>**12345

**Experience:** I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Trento (UNITN). I was a Postdoc at UNITN from 2020-2022 under the supervision of Prof. Nicu Sebe. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 from the Cognitive Science Department at Xiamen University under the supervision of Prof. Shaozi Li . I was also a joint Ph.D. student in 2017-2019 at University of Technology Sydney under the co-supervision of Prof. Yi Yang and Dr. Liang Zheng. I received the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2015 from China University Of Petroleum, Qingdao, China. I received the B.S. degree from the Information Engineering Department, from East China University of Technology in 2012.

**Research Interests:** I am committed to designing robust and scalable visual recognition systems for real-world applications. To achieve this goal, I mainly focus on the areas of data augmentation, unsupervised/semi- supervised learning, domain generalization, domain adaptation and novel class discovery, and investigate their advantages in visual tasks, such as object retrieval, image classification, semantic segmentation, etc.
