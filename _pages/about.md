Hello!

I am currently a Postdoc in the Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG) at the University of Trento, under the supervision of Prof. Nicu Sebe. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 from the Cognitive Science Department at Xiamen University under the supervision of Prof. Shaozi Li . I was also a joint Ph.D. student in 2017-2019 at University of Technology Sydney under the co-supervision of Prof. Yi Yang and Dr. Liang Zheng. I received the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2015 from China University Of Petroleum, Qingdao, China. I received the B.S. degree from the Information Engineering Department, from East China University of Technology in 2012.

My research interests include person re-identification, novel class discovery and domain adaptation.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
